how to handle *really* long lines. writing a bunch of words to make the line extra long. the recommendations are two use two spaces after every sentence. I will try that here.  and now I will try the other method. It is to add <br> but this might only be for html. 
Two spaces did not work but adding < b r > did but without the spaces.
